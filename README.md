# 🛍️ Fashion Image Captioning with BLIP-FACAD and GIT-FACAD

Welcome to the **Fashion Image Captioning** project! This app uses a custom fine-tuned BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) or a fine-tuned GIT (Generative Image-to-Text Transformer) model to generate fashion-related captions from uploaded images or pictures captured via webcam. The captions are then refined by **LLaMA 3.1 70b** for enhanced readability and coherence.

You can try the app live here:

## 🚀 Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload a fashion-related image, and the selected model will generate a caption for it.
- **Webcam Capture**: You can also take a picture via webcam to generate captions.
- **LLaMA Refining**: The generated captions are further refined using the powerful **LLaMA 3.1** model, which corrects grammar and makes the text more human-like and coherent.
