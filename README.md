### 🛍️ Fashion Image Captioning with BLIP-FACAD
Welcome to the Fashion Image Captioning project! This app uses a custom fine-tuned BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pre-training) model to generate fashion-related captions from uploaded images or pictures captured via webcam. The captions are then refined by LLaMA for enhanced readability and coherence.
